First you create a fake main class that does NOT extend application, this class should simply call the real main method.

Example:

public class AlternateMain
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, JSONException, IOException {
        run.Main.main(args);
    }
}

Then you go to Artifacts, click on the + and click on Jar, from modules from dependency then you select your fake main method.
When you can see all the files that are gonna get exported into your jar, you click on the plus and go to where you installed JavaFX.
You then go to the Bin folder and add All the .dll files to the jar file.
Once that is done you simply build the artifact and the JAR will be able to be ran.
